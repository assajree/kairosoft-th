And with one last smile, he headed off to explore another dungeon."
"#01594","To Adventure or Not to Adventure"
"#01595","　Do your adventurers do nothing but lie around the house? Do you wish they'd get out there and actually fight some monsters? We've managed to determine the main reason some fail to live up to expectations. Each adventurer has a ""Work"" attribute that shows how much they're willing to work to improve their town. The higher it is, the more motivated they are to fight monsters. You can help motivate your warriors by giving them items or even awarding medals at the end of the year. Try it with one of your homebodies today!"
"#01596","Rising Star"
"#01597","　Those who have been following the progress of <0> will be happy to learn that the town has received its first star rating.

""But this is only the first step. We'll keep working hard!""<br>   Indeed, we hope this is just the first of many victories for <0>."
"#01598","Two-Star Town"
"#01599","　Never content to rest on its laurels, <0> has been awarded its second star rating.

The new rank proves we're on the right track to become an even better town!""<br>   We offer our congratulations to <0> and wish them the very best in future."
"#01600","Three's a Crowd"
"#01601","　We have just learned that <0>, the outpost town we have been following since its change in management, has received a coveted 3-star rating from the Adventurers Guild. The town's many facilities and growing population have attracted attention from the surrounding area. Some mayors are even looking to <0> for advice on how to turn their own towns around. We hope things continue to go well for <0>."
"#01602","One ""Four"" the Road"
"#01603","　<0>'s rise to fame shows no signs of slowing. In fact, the town has just earned its fourth star ranking. Looking around at its many facilities and satisfied residents, it's easy to see why.<br>   With a fire in their eyes, the mayor told us, ""We won't let this success go to our heads. We're just going to keep on doing what we've always done to make this the kind of place adventurers can fall in love with.""<br>   Just how far will <0>? We have a feeling they're still just getting started."
"#01604","Five Alive"
"#01605","　We have just received word that <0> has received a 5-star rating--the highest rating conferred by the Adventurers Guild. Upon hearing the news, the residents of the town began dancing in the streets. We caught up with the mayor in the empty meeting hall after the celebration had ended.<br>   ""Our quiet little town in the middle of nowhere being awarded such an honor, it's...well, it's unbelievable!""<br>   Well done, mayor. You've earned every one of those stars."
"#01606","School of Hard Knocks"
"#01607","　<0> has been making some impressive additions recently, including a Combat School.<br>   ""Once I swing my sword 10,000 more times, I should be ready to try it on a real monster!"" said one student who was recuperating from muscle pain.<br>   We're all on tenterhooks waiting to see what <0> has in store next."
"#01608","Giving Back to Nature"
"#01609","　<0> is well known for its natural surroundings, and it seems its residents want to honor that. The town recently planted a sacred tree as part of a ceremony intended to give something back to the local environment.<br>   One nature-loving adventurer told us, ""We had trouble finding a place to plant a tree this big, but now it looks like it's been there for years. Between the clean air it provides and the soothing, spiritual atmosphere, it's easy to just hang out and relax here for hours at a time.""<br>   Those seeking a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of modern life should consider paying <0> a visit."
"#01610","Clowning Around"
"#01611","　Crowds have been flocking to <0> to see its latest attraction - a circus ground! This new entertainment facility is already a hit with young-at-heart adventurers.<br>   ""For us, it's all about putting on a show and giving our audience a thrill night after night,"" the ringleader said. ""Now if you'll excuse me, our contortionist has tied herself in a knot and I need to help disentangle her.""<br>   Why not grab some popcorn and make your way to <0> today?"
"#01612","=#00696"
"#01613","　For those of you seeking a more sophisticated dining experience, we recommend the High-Class Restaurant that recently opened in <0>. Adventurers from far and wide are starting to take notice of the venue.<br>   One such patron told us, ""I had my doubts if I'd fit in at a fancy place like this, but now I come here almost every week. It's given me a taste for the finer things in life!""<br>   Be sure not to sleep on this one - the waiting list for a reservation is getting longer by the day!"
"#01614","Back to School"
"#01615","　Class is in session over at <0>. The town recently opened a new schoolhouse to help adventurers bone up on a variety of subjects. We approached one such seeker-after-knowledge for a comment.<br>   ""Studying here has helped me find better, more efficient ways to adventure,"" they said. ""Plus, the cafeteria food is top notch!""<br>   Where will this new focus on education lead <0>? We'll continue to bring you all the latest developments as they happen."
"#01616","The Legend Returns"
"#01617","　Everyone seems to be talking about <0> these days, and that's not likely to change now that the legendary Royal Sword has been discovered there. The weapon in question, which many thought to be nothing more than a myth, was found in the hands of a local hero.<br>   ""I had no idea this thing was so famous. I'd been using it to slice bread. Sorry about that!""<br>   The sword will now be available for adventurers to equip, giving them an edge in battle. We wonder who will be the first to use it."
"#01618","A Fierce Enemy"
"#01619","　<1>, the dreaded monster that has been terrorizing the land, has been defeated at last. Brave adventurers from <0> were able to defeat this enemy despite it being many times their size. As the news has spread, the town is becoming the talk of the monster hunting community. We attempted to interview the ones responsible, but found it difficult to cut through to the facts when ten different adventurers insisted they were the one who struck the finishing blow."
"#01620","A Mage Arrives"
"#01621","　<0> has been gaining in popularity for some time, and has now attracted a mage.<br>   ""This guy showed up in a flash of light,"" said one adventurer. ""I thought maybe the place was on fire, but it turned out it was just a mage teleporting in. Seems a little crazy to me, though...""<br>   Since hearing that some jobs would allow them to use magic, the number of adventurers walking around trying to shoot lightning out of their hands has greatly increased, for better or worse."
"#01622","Bubble Bubble..."
"#01623","　<0> has recently added a Magic Cauldron to the town. Items found on quests or in shops can be simmered down in the cauldron into Magic Points, which can then be converted into rare items or new facilities. Reports also say these Magic Points can be used to make weapons stronger, a feature that local adventurers will surely appreciate!"
"#01624","1,000 Popularity"
"#01625","　According to our calculations, the Popularity of <0> has reached 1,000. We visited the town to get the reactions of the residents.<br>   ""Oh, really? I had no idea,"" said one adventurer.

"#01626","3,000 Popularity"
"#01627","　Flash! <0> has achieved a Popularity rating of 3,000. Even the most optimistic of our editors were surprised at the speed with which the town has grown.

We were later invoiced for it but were happy to pay."
"#01628","5,000 Popularity"
"#01629","　The town of <0> has reached a Popularity score of 5,000. The editor in charge of calculating the totals couldn't believe it at first, and other towns nearby have also expressed their surprise. We sent an undercover reporter to the town to try to determine the secret of their success.<br>   ""It's got a bunch of great facilities for its adventurers. And don't forget the gifts! I can see why people like it so much,"" he said upon his return, his arms piled high with gifts.<br>   Unfortunately, our covert observation was exposed when the reporter couldn't help sending a ""thank you"" card from our editorial offices..."
"#01630","10,000 Popularity"
"#01631","　When we discovered that <0> had reached 10,000 Popularity, a cheer went up throughout our editorial offices.<br>   Asked for comment, the <0>'s mayor said, ""It's hard to put my feelings into words. We've had a lot of laughter and tears, but I have to give my thanks to all of the adventurers who have helped us. I know we can still do better, though.""<br>   The mayor blinked back tears, clearly overcome with emotion. Congratulations!"
"#01632","20,000 Popularity"
"#01633","　We have just learned that <0> has achieved an unprecedented 20,000 Popularity rating. The editor performing the calculation initially thought there had been some mistake, but if any town can do it, it's <0>.

We asked the <0>'s mayor for comment.<br>   ""It doesn't matter how big or small your town is; you just have to work hard, day after day.""<br>   Congratulations on this amazing achievement!"
"#01634","10th Anniversary"
"#01635","　Ten years have passed since the rejuvenation of <0>.

"#01636","20th Anniversary"
"#01637","　Twenty years have now passed since <0>'s landmark revival. The mayor gave a brief speech at a large party attended by adventurers, town leaders, and other local luminaries, seemingly overcome by emotion.<br>   ""Thank you all.

"#01638","50th Anniversary"
"#01639","　Today marks the 50th anniversary of <0>! While the town started out modestly, this bustling burg now appears on every adventurer's ""Best Towns"" list. A grand party was held in honor of the occasion, featuring the town's latest delicacy, <1> Crackers. A small band also performed a song composed by a town leader we all know very well.<br>   ""It should go without saaaying~ Thank you for plaaaying~ But this isn't the eeend~ We'll meet agaaaain...someday ~""<br>   Let's hope the mayor doesn't quit their day job. Congratulations, and good luck!"
"#01640","A Monstrous New Partnership"
"#01641","　Since time immemorial, adventurers and monsters have been enemies. Nobody thought that would ever change...until now. <0> has recruited a mage capable of taming monsters and convincing them to fight alongside their former foes. Our reporters headed over to the newly-built Monster Farm to see these creatures in their new environment.<br>   ""We're all friends here,"" local monster <1> told us. ""We eat, sleep, and train together. The bonds of friendship we've forged mean we can always count on each other in battle, too.""<br>   Could this be the start of a new age of coexistence? Watch this space."
"#01642","A-Mage-ing Developments"
"#01643","　After many years of animosity, bridges are finally being built between the worlds of monster and man. And it's all thanks to the existence of mages. We interviewed one of these talented new class of adventurers. Despite her partner monster gnawing the top of her head, she was all smiles.<br>   ""It's hard to believe we were ever enemies. Once you get to know them, monsters are actually pretty smart. And so cute, too!""<br>   It looks like the day when humans and monsters can live together in peace may not be so far away."

"#01648","Town Guide Triumph"
"#01649","　Our old favorite <0> has passed one of the Town Guide's contests with flying colors. Considering the judging panel's exacting standards, this truly is cause for celebration.<br>   ""Oh, you know, it's just a lucky break,"" the proud mayor told our reporter. ""We thought we'd try to make our town a little more special, and here we are!""<br>   Is luck really all there is to it? We have a feeling this won't be the last time fortune smiles on <0>."
"#01650","Boss Battle Blitz"
"#01651","　It has just come to light that adventurers from <0> have defeated a fearsome boss monster. This news was met with joy and celebration from nearby towns, who had been suffering attacks by this foul beast for some time.<br>   ""I watched the whole battle from a safe distance,"" the mayor told us. ""This monster was hot stuff, but our adventurers never gave up. I couldn't be more proud!""<br>   We look forward to seeing what other challenges the town will overcome going forward."
"#01652","Branching Out"
"#01653","　Having brought peace to <0> and the surrounding area, the mayor has set eyes on new horizons, founding a new town known as <1>. Dropping in to the new settlement, our reporter found it to be a hive of activity.<br>   ""Things are kind of crazy right now while we set everything up,"" the mayor told us in between cups of coffee, ""But a fresh start is just what we need to motivate our adventurers!""<br>   Will <1> be just as big a success as its predecessor? Only time will tell."
"#01654","Thriving Community"
"#01655","　According to the latest data, <0> is now home to 30 resident adventurers. With so many hardened warriors choosing to settle down, the town is safer and more prosperous than ever. We found the mayor's assistant, Vicky Ville, gazing at the collection of houses with tears in her eyes.<br>   ""We were such a tiny little place at first... Who'd have thought we'd have this many people wanting to stay? They're not just residents to us; they're family.""<br>   All the gold they take in from taxes can't hurt, either!"
"#01656","Neighborhood Watching"
"#01657","　<0> has become well-known for its unique traits, with adventurer after adventurer dropping by to see what the town has to offer.<br>   One delighted tourist explained, ""I read about this place in the Town Guide, and it sounded like fun. The scenery's great, and I've already taken a ton of great pictures. Oh, and I've got to remember to grab a couple of souvenirs before I leave.""<br>   Will tourism become a large part of the town's identity from here on? We'll continue to bring you the latest developments as they happen."
"#01658","Conserve Your Trait Points!"
"#01659","　Several of our readers have written in asking for help with a curious phenomenon. These hardworking town leaders have poured their resources into promoting their settlements' unique features, only to see their Trait Points disappear. We reached out to an expert from the Town Guide for an explanation.<br>   ""Using items or holding events is a good start, but it doesn't end there. After a while, your points will start going down again. You have to stagger your events and item use to maintain a good score.""<br>   Fascinating stuff.

"#01959","Total Clear Points:<br><0>"

"#01961","From this point on, your high score won't change."
,"But you can continue playing for as long as you like."
,"We hope you'll enjoy the game for a long time to come."
"#01962","Hello there!"
,"Nice to meet you! My name's Vicky Ville. Starting today, I'll be assisting you with <0>."
,"You know, this place used to be a bustling town full of people and businesses."
,"But ever since the previous mayor set out on a journey and never came back, it's really gone downhill."
,"We need to turn this into a <pic=star1>5 town that any adventurer worth their salt will want to visit!"
,"So how about we get started right away? Select ""Build"" from the menu and build a store."
"#01963","<0> adventurers are taking part. I can't wait to see the results!"
"#01964","<0> adventurers are taking part in your first expedition."
,"I'm sure they'll bring back lots of treasure! I can't wait!"
"#01965","Come again!"
"#01966","You don't have enough money."
"#01967","You don't have enough <pic=tpoint0>Town Points."

"#01972","You have no facilities at the moment."
"#01973","You don't have enough Magic Points."
"#01974","The Cauldron is full."
,"Boiling these ingredients will take a while. Come back later to check up on it."
"#01975","That is the current job."
"#01976","It's the end of the year. And the Adventurers Guild has sent us a <pic=medal0>medal."
,"You can give adventurers medals to boost their <pic=moti0>Satisfaction and <pic=moti1>Work, as well as their combat ability."
,"Take some time to think about who could use it the most."
"#01977","This concludes the awards ceremony."
,"Good luck for next year!"
"#01978","<pic=medal0>Medals left: <0>."
"#01979","Thank you! I'll keep working hard to develop the town!"

"#01982","There are no quests available at the moment."
"#01983","Our adventurers discovered a new dungeon!"
"#01984","Let's send out a party to explore it!"
"#01985","Hello."
,"I was just passing through, but I like this town so much I'm thinking of moving here."
,"Could you find me a place to live?"
,"I'll be waiting."
"#01986","A home of my own at last. I'm so happy!"
,"I'll work hard to make this town a place other adventurers will want to live in, too."

,"See you later."
"#01989","This is great! I'll never forget what you've done for me. Probably."

"#01990","Thank you. I'm looking forward to my new life."

"#01992","Take this, with my thanks."
"#01993","Please accept this as a reward."

"#01995","Hello. I'm the head of the Adventurers Guild. We help introduce adventurers to towns across the kingdom."
,"<0> is currently at <pic=star1>0 in our rankings. In other words, no stars."
,"You can earn a star by fulfilling the required conditions. I hope you'll give it a try."
"#01996","Getting a star rating will help increase your town's <pic=raup0>Popularity and attract new adventurers."
"#01997","Sweet! So all we need to do to rank up and get out first star is fulfill these conditions!"
"#01998","Check the conditions under ""Manage"" > ""Upgrade Town"" and try to fulfill them!"
"#01999","Hello, I'm from the Adventurers Guild."
,"I see that <0> doesn't have a star rating yet..."
,"You can get a star rating if you fulfill the required conditions. I hope you'll give it a try."
,"Titles aren't just for show. They grant special bonus effects to the town, that I think you may be interested in."
"#02000","So if we fulfill these conditions, our town will rise in rank and get a star rating."
,"Check the conditions under ""Manage"" > ""Upgrade Town"" and try to fulfill them!"
"#02001","Hey Boss, I've got something to tell you."
,"<0> has fulfilled the conditions for a new rank!"
"#02002","Congratulations. The town has met the conditions for a new rank."
,"Let's head on over to the awards ceremony!"
"#02003","We don't met the requirements for a star yet... Let's review the conditions and make sure we fulfill every one of them."
"#02004","We just have one more thing to do before we can earn a title!"
,"Let's do this!"
"#02005","Here are the conditions for achieving the next rank."
"#02006","I have some news."
,"The next set of rank-up requirements has been announced."
"#02007","Work hard and I'm sure you'll meet them!"
"#02008","Congratulations on making Rank <pic=star1><1>. What a remarkable development for <0>!"
,"You will now be able to purchase new facilities and hold new events. Use them well."
,"I also wanted to give you this to mark the occasion."
"#02009","Well done."
,"I never imagined <0> would make it all the way to the top someday..."
,"Okay, let's get the celebrations for reaching the highest rank underway!"
"#02010","I hereby declare you a <0>-star town!"
,"Year after year has flown by in this town... It's enough to bring a tear to your eye..."
,"Still, <0> isn't done yet. I look forward to seeing what you do in the future!"
"#02011","You've already reached the highest rank."
,"I knew you could do it!"
"#02012","There are no available events at the moment."
"#02013","We can't hold any more events this season."
"#02014","There's no available advertising at the moment."
"#02015","I have some news."
,"A dungeon has been discovered just outside town!"
"#02016","Discovered dungeons that are available for exploration will show up under ""Quests"" in the Adventure menu."
,"There could be lots of treasure hidden there. We should take a look!"
"#02017","Uh-oh, a group of monsters has appeared outside our town!"
,"""Quests"" have been added to the Adventure menu!"
,"Let's go defeat the monsters and keep our town safe!"
"#02018","We can now hold <pic=raup2>events here in <0>."

,"Events contribute greatly to a town's development, so hold as many as you can!"
"#02019","""<0>"" is currently in progress."
"#02020","No more adventurers can join."
"#02021","All right, let's get this show on the road!"
"#02022","<0> months have passed since the quest began."
,"Additional funds are needed to continue the quest."
"#02023","An adventurer house can be built here."
,"Adventurers may want to settle in your town once their <pic=moti0>Satisfaction reaches a certain level."
"#02024","It looks like an adventurer wants to <pic=t_ca6>move to <0>!"
"#02025","Why not build them a house right here?"
"#02026","Adventurers will only ask to move in if you have <pic=t_ca6> vacant houses in town."
,"So try to have extra <pic=t_ca6> vacant houses available."
"#02027","This <pic=t_ca8>store sells weapons, which are vital for fighting off monsters."
,"Adventurers can buy equipment here."
,"You can get new weapons as the town develops, or by clearing dungeons."
"#02028","This <pic=t_ca8>store sells armor for adventurers."
,"It helps reduce damage taken in combat."
,"You can get new weapons as the town develops, or by clearing dungeons."
"#02029","This is the <pic=t_ca8>accessory store."
,"You can sell the accessories you find on quests here."
"#02030","This is the <pic=t_ca5>inn."
,"Adventurers can stay at an inn to recover HP."
,"The inn's rates will go up when other facilities are nearby or if you use items on it."
"#02031","Completing the new facility has boosted the town's <pic=raup0>Popularity, shown at the bottom right!"
,"The more popular your <pic=raup0>town is, the more adventurers will come visit."
,"Whatever happens next, I'm sure it'll be interesting."
"#02032","An adventurer has showed up at the town gates!"
,"Adventurers will buy equipment in town before setting out to fight monsters."
,"I hope they find what they're looking for here in <0>!"
"#02033","There's a battle going on outside town!"
,"Let's go watch how it plays out."
"#02034","Woohoo! They successfully defeated the monster."
,"When adventurers defeat monsters, they get Experience Points and the town gets money."
,"Try to defeat a lot of monsters to help the town develop."
"#02035","Well done. Your first dungeon quest is now complete."
,"As you can see, some dungeons have valuable treasure inside."
,"Be sure to send out adventurers whenever you discover new dungeons!"
"#02036","Hello."
,"I've been to a lot of towns, but this one is just what I've been looking for."
,"I'd love to move here, if you could build a house for me."
"#02037","Hello."
,"What an amazing town! I absolutely love it here."
,"This is the place for me. I just know it! I'd appreciate it if you could build me a house."
"#02038","Hello."
,"I'm surprised to find such a wonderful town out here."
,"If you could build me a house, I'd be happy to move in."
"#02039","Hello."
,"I finally found the town that's perfect for me. It's <0> all the way!"
,"I bet it'd be a ton of fun living here. Can you build me a house?"
"#02040","Welcome!"
,"We get new items in regularly, so check back from time to time."
"#02041","You can send <pic=indicate0>gifts to your adventurers here."
,"First, pick an adventurer you want to give new items or equipment to."
"#02042","You can send them anything you've got in your inventory, free of charge."
,"Try sending some strong equipment to help them become more powerful!"
"#02043","Here you can use <pic=tpoint0>Town Points (displayed at the upper right) to hold events in town."
,"They can be effective in boosting the town's <pic=raup0>Popularity and your adventurers' stats."
"#02044","Welcome."
,"This is no ordinary pot. It allows you to make items, upgrade weapons, and more."
,"Throw in some items and see what happens!"
"#02045","Congratulations! You can now use the Magic Cauldron!"
,"Use it to develop new equipment, facilities, and even rare items."
,"Select ""Manage"" from the menu, then select ""Cauldron."""
"#02046","Items you place in the Cauldron will gradually boil away and turn into Magic Points."
,"You can use Magic Points to make new items and facilities, so long as you have the right recipe."
,"You'll discover new recipes as your Knowledge increases."
"#02047","You already have a <0>."
"#02048","New creation: <0>!"
"#02049","An adventurer just got enough Experience Points to level up."
,"Higher levels mean better HP, Attack, and a better time overall!"
"#02050","Big news! An expedition turned up a new weapon: <0>!"
,"Weapons you discover will be sold at the town's <pic=t_ca8>weapon shop for other adventurers to buy."
,"You can also <pic=indicate0>give them directly to an adventurer you want to make stronger."
"#02051","You can check adventurers' stats and equipment here."
,"You can also follow adventurers or give them <pic=indicate0>gifts."
"#02052","You can change an adventurer's job here."
,"Each job has different strengths and special abilities, so choose wisely!"
"#02053","Adventurers can change jobs once they master their current job."
,"To change jobs, select ""Give Task"" from the Adventurer Info screen."
"#02054","From here, you can select new facilities to build."
,"Select the <pic=shop02_1>Weapons Store and give it a try!"
"#02055","We've got a facility that's not accessible."
,"Adventurers won't be able to use facilities if they can't get to them."
"#02056","One of the adventurers now has an aura!"
,"Auras temporarily increase an adventurer's Attack and Defense."
,"Having a high <pic=moti1>Work attribute will make developing an aura more likely."
"#02057","Tap on a vacant location to see a list of people who want to move in."
"#02058","We finally have some <pic=t_ca6>private homes here in <0>."
,"Adventurers with homes in town will pay taxes according to the number of monsters they defeat."
,"That means attracting more residents will help keep the kingdom safe, and make us some money, too!"
"#02059","Congratulations! <1> has reached mastery in the <0> profession!"
,"Adventurers keep all their old stats even after switching jobs."
,"Get adventurers to change jobs over and over to help them develop!"
"#02060","Hi there! I travel across the land introducing towns to the wonders of Pumpkin Products. Items, facilities, we've got it all!"
,"I've always been too scared of the monsters nearby to visit your town, but now I feel a lot safer."
,"I have a variety of items that will come in handy for your town and adventurers."
,"Why not take a look and browse my wares?"
"#02061","You can shop at any time by selecting ""Manage"" from the menu and then selecting ""Store."""
,"As your town develops further, I'll be able to sell you more items."
"#02062","It's time to collect taxes from our resident adventurers."
"#02063","The total for this year comes up to <0>G!"
,"Let's invest this money wisely and help make the town a better place."
"#02064","Hello."
,"I heard <0> has been doing really well lately."
,"You should try holding an event to drum up even more interest in your town."
"#02065","Hello."
,"The Adventurers Guild has received reports of many adventurers working out of <0>."
,"I came to give you a <pic=medal0> medal in recognition of your great work. You can give it to one of your adventurers."
"#02066","Hello."
,"I heard <0> has been doing really well lately."
,"Now might be a good time to expand your town limits and give yourself more space."
"#02067","You've made the right choice. You can now expand your <pic=aseve5>town."
,"Let's put that extra space to good use with some nifty new facilities!"
,"Select ""Manage"" from the menu, then select ""Hold Event."""
"#02068","Look! The <pic=raup0>Popularity gauge at the bottom right is full!"
"#02069","Thank you."
,"There used to be a group of monsters blocking the road, but now I can get to the next town for supplies."
,"Thanks to that, I've got more products available in my store. Stop in for a look sometime!"
"#02070","Hello."
,"I've heard that <0> is a wonderful town."
,"I think I'll be stopping by from time to time. See you around!"
"#02071","Our adventurers aren't doing great against the monsters lately..."
,"Why don't you try <pic=indicate0>gifting them some new equipment?"
"#02072","While we were investigating an area outside of town..."
,"A new dungeon was discovered: <0>!"
,"I smell treasure. Let's go explore!"
"#02073","While we were investigating an area outside of town..."
,"We spotted a pack of monsters!"
,"Let's take care of them before they have a chance to cause trouble!"
"#02074","Some massive ruins were discovered outside of town!"
,"I've heard tales of a fearsome monster that destroyed countless towns... Could it be...?"
"#02075","A nasty-looking <0> has been spotted outside town."
,"Let's see if we can capture it!"
"#02076","Hello."
,"You really did a number on me in our last fight."
,"But things won't be so easy this time!"
"#02077","Hello."
,"I heard what you did to my pals."
,"This time, you're gonna get what's coming to you!"
"#02078","Hello."
,"You've been bullying my kind, haven't you!"
,"It's your turn to get a beating!"
"#02079","This concludes the awards ceremony."
,"We'll have to wait until next year for a chance at the medals we missed out on."
"#02080","Oh, no... My beautiful house..."
"#02081","That poor adventurer. Why don't you build them another house?"
"#02082","<0> isn't in town right now."
"#02083","B-B-Boss, we have a situation!"
,"The dreaded monster <0> has appeared!"
,"If we don't defeat it quickly, the town's Popularity will plummet!"
"#02084","Gyaaargh! How could I make the same mistakes again...?!"
"#02085","Nrgh... I'll be back. I always come back!"
"#02086","Yowch... I'll pencil in another battle with you later in my schedule!"
"#02087","Nooo, I lost! ...Can you at least scratch my back before I go?"
"#02088","Curse you! I haven't had this many bruises since I tripped and fell to the bottom of my canyon."
"#02089","Urgh, this isn't how it played out in my head at all! I'll get you next time!"
"#02090","Waaah! I'm gonna tell my mom on you!"
"#02091","All right, you can have the bananas, just don't hurt me!"
"#02092","Oof... My bark will never be the same..."
"#02093","Huff... Puff... I just remembered, I have a party to go to. Laters!"
"#02094","I give! Let's call it a day."
"#02095","I lost... I'll have to find somewhere new to play. See ya!"
"#02096","Somebody pinch me, I must be dreaming. There's no way I could really lose!"
"#02097","Looks like my turtle power doesn't have any effect here..."
"#02098","Whoops, guess luck wasn't on my side today. Congrats on your victory, cousin."
"#02099","I really slipped up this time! Fights like this just don't a-peel to me."
"#02100","That was intense... I've gotta go cool off!"
"#02101","Hey, go easy on me! I never expected you to be this tough."
"#02102","Ngraaargh! Next time, I'll fight you with everything I've got!"
"#02103","The icy winds have calmed my mind. I see now there is no point in fighting. Good day to you."
"#02104","I have collected enough data for one day. Goodbye for now, ouch, I'm hurting all-over."
"#02105","Losing with dignity is the first step to achieving true victory. Until we meet again."
"#02106","That tears it, I'm outta here!"
"#02107","Urgh...! I-I can see you're serious. Let's just call it a draw, okay?"
"#02108","Nooo! You've ruined my reputation!"
"#02109","Yikes... I wish I'd studied more. I'm sure I missed some good advice on Page 37..."
"#02110","I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused. I promise to live a good, honest life from now on."
"#02111","You win this round, but I'll come back, two-ply and stronger than ever!"
"#02112","W-Will you let me off the hook if I give you this slice of cake?"
"#02113","Win or lose, that was still a pretty sweet battle. We gotta do this again sometime!"
"#02114","I-I've got a cold today, that's the only reason I lost!"
,"Party's over!"
"#02115","Waaah! I was going to immortalize my victory in a self-published manga..."
"#02116","I think it's time for me to rethink my career options..."
"#02117","You're the first one to ever survive my special attack. ...Actually, this is the first time I've ever used it!"
"#02118","Not bad. But the way I see it, I only lost to myself, not you!"
"#02119","I was thinking about the New Years party so much I couldn't concentrate on the fight!"
"#02120","Well done, Grasshopper. I have nothing more to teach you."
,"KABOOM!"
"#02121","I'm coming apart at the seams! I'll be back once I experiment with some different materials."
"#02122","I may have lost, but I still got to discharge all that excess energy. That's a win in my books!"
,"Aw, boo!"
"#02123","Oww... I'd better go grab some medicine from Pumpkin Products."
"#02124","At least this'll give me a chance to find a new fried chicken joint. So thanks for that!"
"#02125","It's no good, I'm at my limit... But I did my best, and that's got to be worth something."
,"Farewell, until we meet again!"
"#02126","Howdy! I hear you defeated the dread monster <0>."
,"That's great! Thanks to you, we're one step closer to a safe, peaceful kingdom."
,"Take this as a token of my gratitude."
"#02127","Items that adventurers find outside of town will be sent to the warehouse."
,"Items in the warehouse can be <pic=indicate0>given to adventurers or used to upgrade facilities."
,"Remember to make the most of your items."
"#02128","Nice to meet you."
,"I'm a monster from the area. I thought I'd come and attack your town."
,"I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of each other in future skirmishes. Well, bye!"
"#02129","Hello there."
,"I smelled some tasty townspeople in the area, so I decided to stop by."
,"I can't wait to find out how strong your adventurers are."
"#02130","Hi, how's it going?"
,"Sure is a lot going on here lately. Thought I'd come take a look."
,"Nice town you got here. In fact, I think I'll make it mine... You'll be seeing a lot of me!"
"#02131","Good day. Lovely weather we're having."
,"I've heard this area gets lots of sunshine."
,"Hmm... Those buildings are in the way! I'm going to knock them down!"
"#02132","Hateful humans!"
,"You and I have unfinished business to take care of."
,"I hate this lively town! I'm going to drag you all back to the underworld with me!"
"#02133","Bwahaha!"
,"I'm undefeated in the monster world. Think any of you humans can stand up to me?!"
,"Awright, show me what you got! Come at me! Hahahaaa!"
"#02134","Hm?"
,"I was digging through the ground when I happened upon this town."
,"I won't stand for anyone getting in the way of my digging!"
"#02135","Vrrr... Wsssh, ka-chak!"
,"After receiving a notification that my friends were defeated, I just had to come!"
,"I'll bet you can't defeat someone with an ion-powered high-tech body like mine."
"#02136","Hello."
,"I've gotta say, this is a great town. Nice scenery, friendly neighbors, dungeons right nearby..."
,"I'd love to explore those dungeons some more. Could you find me a place to live?"
"#02137","Hello."
,"The soil around here is so nice and loamy. Perfect for growing crops!"
,"I've always wanted to try farming for myself. Now all I need is my own house!"
"#02138","Hello."
,"I just love this town. There are so many wonderful shops!"
,"Can you make me a wonderful house to go with them?"

,"I'd really appreciate it if you could build me a vacation home here."
"#02178","Hey there."
,"It's fascinating just how much I can learn from watching adventurers in this town..."

"#02185","Heheheh..."
,"Finally, a real challenge. This is just the place I've been looking for."

,"It's been so long since I last terrorized some humans."
,"Can't let my skills or my stinger get rusty, y'know? Prepare yourself!"
"#02206","Hello there."
,"Plenty of mushroom monsters agree I'm a fun guy, but they don't realize I can be strong, too."
,"Once I defeat you, no one will be able to deny my power. Hahahaaa!"
"#02207","Hello there."
,"Back in the day, my dad was a movie star. He shot a ton of pictures right here."
,"This land is mine by right! I won't let you steal it!"
"#02208","Zzz... Mm? Oh, hello..."
,"To be honest, I don't care that you defeated my brothers all that much..."
,"But you're going to pay for disturbing my nap! Raaargh!"
"#02209","Hi, how's it going?"

"#02214","Hello. I've been hearing a lot about your town."

,"Don't get cocky just because you beat my brothers. I'm the one who'll win this battle!"
"#02215","Hello there."
,"Would you like some shaved ice? It's pure and refreshing."

"#02224","Hello."
,"I attached all this cake to myself so I'd never have to go hungry. Smart, right?"
,"Now I'll turn YOU into cake and chow down!"
"#02225","Hey. Am I glad to see you."
,"I just baked a fresh batch of cookies. They've got seven types of sugar in 'em. Try some!"
,"You don't want any...? Not even a little bite? Fine, then I'll just take a bite out of you!"
"#02226","Aha, found you!"

"#02231","Hello there."
,"Let me tell you, I'm no ordinary fox."
,"Hold onto your hat, because I'm...a fox who likes noodles! What a shocker, am I right?"
"#02232","Whirr... Clank!"
,"Generating battle analysis... It appears the other monsters have been too soft on you."
,"I will not make that mistake. My AI will calculate the optimum battle strategy to defeat you, beep!"
"#02233","Did you hear? It's gonna rain in the Underworld for the first time in 10 years!"
,"And here's me thinking I could save money by replacing my bandages with toilet paper."
,"I'm gonna get soaked and fall to pieces! I'd better defeat you while I still have the chance!"
"#02234","Hello there."
,"You couldn't have come at a better time. I've got all this electricity running through me and nothing to do with it."
,"Giving you young folks a couple o' shocks should do the trick. Bzzzt!"
"#02235","Oh, hi there!"
,"My pal over at Pumpkin Products hooked me up with some new items."
,"With gear this good, there's no way I'll lose this battle. Bwahaha!"
"#02236","Hey there."
,"I saved all the fried chicken I could from my favorite restaurant before it closed."
,"This is my last drumstick... I'm not giving it up for anyone!"
"#02237","Heheheheh... Well, whad'ya know?"
,"Never thought you'd make it this far. You're stronger than I thought, I'll give you that."
,"But now that I'm here, all that's about to end. You have no idea who you're dealing with."
,"I've been taking night classes so I could learn how to beat you. Time for the final exam!"
"#02238","What?! Our funds have dipped into the negative..."
,"I can help you out with my personal savings. Just don't waste them."
,"This is our last resort, so use these funds wisely!"
,"You can get more money by selling items to stores or using items on facilities to boost sales."
"#02239","The quest has been canceled."
,"Why not train some adventurers and try again later?"
,"To strengthen adventurers, try holding <pic=raup2>events or <pic=indicate0>giving them new equipment."
"#02240","At the moment, there are <1> shops in <0>."
,"The more stores you have, the more <pic=raup0>popular we'll become."
,"You might want to build a couple more to help the town along."
"#02241","Your funds are in the negative..."
,"At times like this, try selling items you're not using for some quick cash."
"#02242","Heh. It's been a long time."
,"Our family has used those bitter experiences to start a new life!"
,"We've been eating protein pudding every day to help strengthen our bodies!"
,"We're much stronger than before, make no mistake!"
,"We'll beat you this time for sure!"
"#02243","We've been working hard to improve ourselves..."
,"But I think we have reached our limit."
,"Still, we'll keep fighting!"
,"As long as our family, and Kairosoft, remains."
"#02244","Ah, I've been waiting for this moment."
,"There's strength in numbers. We're going to win this time!"
"#02245","Oh boy!"
,"I have a feeling there'll be lots of treasure in this dungeon!"
,"This is gonna be so much fun!"
"#02246","Whoa... Check this out!"
,"I've never seen so much treasure."
,"I thought about sleeping through this one, but I'm glad I came!"
"#02247","Wow!"
,"Looks like this dungeon's crawling with monsters..."
,"We might need reinforcements to help us out with this one."
"#02248","Yikes! This dungeon is filled to the brim with monsters..."
,"But that must mean they're guarding some amazing treasure!"
,"We're on fire now!"
"#02249","Let's keep going until we've cleared one of each Dungeon Exploration quests!"
"#02250","You don't have any adventurers who can join this quest."
"#02251","A new Town Guide contest started."

"#02344","<0> returned to the wild."
"#02345","There's a monster who wants to join us...except the <pic=t_ca0>Monster Farm is full."
,"Partner monsters can't join adventurers on quests unless there's space for them on the farm."
,"Let's build an extra <pic=t_ca0> Monster farm to make room!"
"#02346","You can now cultivate a new type of farmland!"
"#02347","Adventurers will help out on the <pic=t_ca0>farm when they have time."

,"Let's keep up the good work and increase our <pic=raup0> Popularity even more!"
"#02353","Nice! The plans for the new facility we ordered have arrived."
"#02354","Why don't we get the ball rolling and build it right away?"
"#02355","Our new <0> is now officially open!"

"#02358","There are some partner monsters roaming around with nothing to do."
"#02359","Let's build a new <0> for them!"
"#02360","Sometimes when you take a mage on a monster slaying quest, monsters will become tame and join you."

"#02362","You must master <1> before you can change to the <0> job."
"#02363","<0> successfully built!"
"#02364","Eureka! I have an idea for a new event."
"#02365","You can't let any more adventurers go."
"#02366","Hi! I've heard a lot of good stuff about <0>, so I decided to visit."
,"It's always been my dream to live in peace with the monsters. Maybe I can finally make that a reality here."
,"I'll see you around. Wish me luck!"
"#02367","Oh, and this is my partner, <0>."
"#02368","Let's build a <pic=t_ca0>Monster Farm to take care of our partner monsters!"
"#02369","The <pic=t_ca0>Monster Farm is complete. Nice work!"
,"The <pic=t_ca0>farm can hold up to five monsters that haven't been assigned a human partner yet."
,"You can assign a partner monster by going to ""Adventure"" in the main menu and selecting ""Monsters."""

"#02374","You can now rearrange your facilities! Try to make the scenery look nice for everyone."
"#02375","Use the Magic Cauldron to create new items!"
"#02376","You can built different types of <pic=t_ca6>adventurer houses. Choose one and let's get started!"

"#02381","Oh, by the way..."

"#02383","Congratulations! At this rate, the town is going to grow into something really special!"
"#02384","People are starting to talk about <0>'s worse traits..."
"#02385","We'd better nip this in the bud before our reputation suffers any more!"
"#02386","Nice. <0>'s starting to attract more visitors."
"#02387","Here's a little something to celebrate. Keep up the good work!"
"#02388","One, two... One, two... Oh, hi there."
,"I was out on my morning jog when I spotted your amazing town!"
,"Kinda inconvenient to find all these houses blocking my optimal route, though. I'm gonna make you pay for this!"
"#02389","Hello."
,"I heard a nifty new town had been built around here..."
,"I guess this is it, huh? Okay, let's see what you got!"
"#02390","Whoopsie!"
,"Sorry, my thrusters malfunctioned, so I had to make an emergency landing. Eheheh..."
,"I need to work out my frustration somehow, though... How about a battle?"
"#02391","Hello."
,"My shoulders are aching... I think I've been slouching over my desk a little too much."
,"I could use a nice, physical workout to loosen myself up. Let's do this!"
"#02392","Ohoho. Hello there."
,"So you're the upstart little town that's been giving monsters so much trouble?"
,"I'll burn you up like a summer bonfire!"
"#02393","Hello."
,"I got separated from my friends a while back."
,"I'd really like to have a cool story to tell when I find them, so I'm gonna beat you up!"
"#02394","Why, hello there."
,"My friends told me this was a cool town to come visit, but..."
,"No, no, no! This isn't what I expected at all! We'll have to tear the whole place down and start again!"
"#02395","Bzzzt!"
,"I'm in condition today. My energy levels are through the roof!"
,"Oh, are you one of my fans? Do you want my autograph?"
"#02396","Good to meet you. I just moved here."
,"So, hey... Isn't there anywhere around here I can get a bite to eat?"
,"Eh, maybe I'll just chomp down on this little town instead!"
"#02397","Hi there, can I interest you in a new comforter?"
,"They're stuffed with my own feather down. Just 1,000,000G each!"
,"What do you mean, no?! Don't you know a good deal when you see it? I'm gonna have to beat some sense into you!"
"#02398","Clank, clank."
,"I detect I have decreased in mass considerably. I went too far with my diet..."
,"I will now proceed to demolish all in my path until my hunger is sated!"
"#02399","Hi, nice to meet you."
,"I'm on the lookout for new food sources. My family's going hungry back home."
,"Hey, you humans smell pretty tasty... Sorry, I have a feeling I might lose control around you...!"
"#02400","Hello."
,"Listen up - the sky belongs to me! I won't stand for any mere humans threatening my dominion."
,"Prepare for a world of hurt!"
"#02401","Hrr... Hello!"
,"My throat has been killing me lately. I can't remember the last time I got through a whole song."
,"A good battle should help me get my breathing under control. What do you say?"
"#02402","Hello there!"
,"My mecha-brain's calculations indicate destroying your town will help my career immensely."
,"I appreciate the sacrifice you're about to make. I'll try to make this quick."
"#02403","Hello. Nice to meet you."
,"I was sooo bored today, so I thought it might be fun to go explore somewhere new."
,"Now how about a battle to round off the day? C'mon, show me what you got!"
"#02404","Assign this monster to one of your adventurers."
"#02405","You haven't mastered any jobs yet."
"#02406","Congratulations!"

"#02408","This field will now grow <0>!"
"#02409","Choose a crop to grow."
"#02410","Thank you!"
"#02411","One of our adventurers doesn't have a house. Better assign one to them!"
"#02412","I have some news."
,"The next set of rank-up requirements for <0> has been announced."
"#02413","What?! Our funds have dipped into the negative..."
"#02414","Good thing I buried some <pic=tpoint1>Diamond Points in the backyard for just such an emergency!"
,"Select ""Store"" from the main menu, then go to ""Exchange Diamond Points"" for some quick cash!"
"#02415","<0> cannot change jobs."
"#02416","Congrats on your <pic=star1>5 rating!"
"#02417","We hope you'll enjoy the rest of the game and leave a review!"

"#02422","Hey, it's been a while."
,"I heard <0> was doing well. I wanted to see it for myself."
,"I have to say, I've got a good feeling about this!"
"#02423","Heheheheh... Well, whad'ya know?"
,"I never thought my turn would come, but here we are."
,"I'm all rested up and ready to give it my all."
,"And with my family all working together, there's no way we'll lose. I'll pulverize you!"
"#02424","Yowch, not again... I really thought this was our year."
,"Well, we're still not giving up! Farewell, until we meet again!"
"#02425","Hello."
,"Seems like <0> is getting more popular every day."
